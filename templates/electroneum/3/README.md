# Electroneum Node

Creates a node to fully sync the blockchain.

This is the `v0.11.0.0-revert` image tag which is built directly from the `v0.11.0.0-revert` branch.
If you're using the `v0.11.1.0` version, you should update to this one immediately.

- See the [Official Electroneum Site](https://electroneum.com/) if you've never heard of this before
- Recommended to use the default ports when possible
- Exposing the RPC port to the outside world is **not** recommended
- View the [Project on Github](https://github.com/jc21/docker-electroneumd) for documentation on advanced usage
