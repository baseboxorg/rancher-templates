- See the [Official Ethereum Site](https://geth.ethereum.org) if you've never heard of this before
- Recommended to use the default ports when possible
- Exposing the RPC port to the outside world is **not** recommended
- View the [Project on Github](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum) for documentation
- **Storage should be on a fast SSD for best results!**
